•	Created a deep learning architecture for classification problem to classify images from the Fashion Mnist dataset into ten fashion products.

•	The pipeline for the multilayer perceptron neutral architecture consisted on the stem, backbone and classifier blocks. The images were divided into patches and were feed to the pipeline for classification.
